# Project: Cloud Data Warehouse
## Summary of the Project

I will provide discussion on the process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

## Files in the Repository
The project includes four files:
- create_table.py: creates the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
- etl.py: loads data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then processes that data into analytics tables on Redshift.
- sql_queries.py: defines the SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.

## How to run the Python scripts

## Process
Discuss the purpose of this database in context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.

The README file includes a summary of the project, how to run the Python scripts, and an explanation of the files in the repository. Comments are used effectively and each function has a docstring.
